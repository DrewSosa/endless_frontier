The Common Fund is a unique resource at NIH, functioning as a “venture capital” space where high-risk, innovative endeavors with the potential for extraordinary impact can be supported. Common Fund programs are short-term, goal-driven strategic investments, with deliverables intended to catalyze research across multiple biomedical research disciplines.",

Eisenhower in response to the Soviet launching of Sputnik 1 in 1957. By collaborating with academia, industry, and government partners, DARPA formulates and executes research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, often beyond immediate U.S. military requirements. DARPA is independent of other military research and development and reports directly to senior Department of Defense management.",

The funds would go toward projects the private sector would be unlikely to take on without assistance due to “technical and financial uncertainty.” Research conducted with the grants would be aimed at reducing costs of the construction and maintenance of roads, bridges and mass transit, lowering the environmental impacts of related projects and boosting their resiliency to physical and cyber threats. ARPA-I would be headed up by a Senate-confirmed director, who would then be granted wide latitude to build a workforce for the agency."

A challenge-based acquisition is not only a prize competition but one where the prize is the purchase of the winning solution by the federal agency.

This can be used to commit to purchase a product that doesn’t exist yet, which will de-risk private investment in R&D and manufacturing.  An Advance Market Commitment for a pneumococcal vaccine has resulted in the immunization of 150 million children, and saved the lives of 700,00 people.  Operation Warp Speed negotiated agreements with multiple companies to purchase millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines, contingent on FDA approval (Emergency Use Authorization)."

			"description":"Volume Guarantees are a commitment from a buyer to purchase a minimum quantity of an existing product at a set price from multiple vendors. This is generally a long-term, multi-year contract providing stability and security for the manufacturer and often allowing the buyer to negotiate a reduced price for the product or service.  The federal government uses the concept of volume guarantees in their indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract type but does not leverage the techniques to shape markets or stimulate innovation. Federal agencies obligate one-third of their funding through IDIQ and spend more than $130 billion annually on these types of contracts."

This mechanism is used by the federal government for multi-year contracts as well as to jump-start production of a product or service needed for war or national defense. It is not used for the purposes of shaping markets. Just like volume guarantees, there is an opportunity to reimagine the use of APAs for market shaping and generating innovative solutions to challenging problems."

It is a short distance northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. \n Los Alamos was selected as the top-secret location for bomb design in late 1942 and officially commissioned the next year, under the management of the University of California.[5] At the time it was known as Project Y and was the center for weapon design and overall coordination. Other labs, today known as Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Hanford Site, concentrated on the production of uranium and plutonium bomb fuels. Los Alamos was the heart of the project, collecting together some of the world's most famous scientists, among them numerous Nobel Prize winners. The site was known variously as Project Y, Los Alamos Laboratory, and Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory through this period.",

The facility is located in Lemont, Illinois, outside of Chicago, and is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the Midwest. \n Argonne had its beginnings in the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, formed in part to carry out Enrico Fermi's work on nuclear reactors for the Manhattan Project during World War II. After the war, it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1, 1946. In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics, designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors, helping design the reactors used by the United States' nuclear navy, and a wide variety of similar projects. In 1994, the lab's nuclear mission ended, and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research, energy storage and renewable energy, environmental sustainability, supercomputing, and national security.",
